# TCP---Communication
This virtual machine will be my work environment where I will be experimenting and practicing with various tools such as scripting languages Python. I will also be using Wireshark to capture any traffic filtering through my WIFI device and analyse the network communication such as TCP. It will be useful if I also install these virtual machines on my portable laptop because when Iâ€™m away from my main desktop I need to be able to do this same work without many issues.
